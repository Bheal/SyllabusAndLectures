## <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-up"></i> Objectives for the week

- Peer discussion/feedback

- Further work on Collaborative Research Project

## Peer discussion/feedback

**First**: take ~12 minutes to come up with a **five minute pitch** for your project:

- What is your research question? Why is it interesting?

- What data did you gather/methods did you use?

- What are your results? How do you plan to present these?

- What issue do you still have/questions you want to ask?

**Second**: Pair with *one* other group and **give your pitch** + **ask** the
other pair **at least two questions** about their project.

**Third**: Show the other group **your GitHub repo**. Explain how it is
**organised**. Pick one file and **explain what this file does** in detail.
