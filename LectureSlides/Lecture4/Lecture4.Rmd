## <i class="fa fa-bolt"></i> Class change!

**4 November class -> 18 November**

Reversed order of Automatic Table/Plot Generation and Statistical Modelling
Topics.


## <i class="fa fa-certificate"></i> Pair Assignment 1

- **Due:** Friday 7 October

- Learning objectives: develop your understanding of

    - **file structures**,

    - **version control**,

    - **basic R data structures** and **descriptive statistics**.

## <i class="fa fa-certificate"></i> Pair Assignment 1

Each pair will create a **new public GitHub repository**

- Must be **fully documented**, including with a **descriptive README.md**
    file. Your code must be **human readable** and **clearly commented**.

- Include **R source** code files that:

    - Access at least **two** data sets from the R core data sets and/or [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) 

    - Illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety of **relevant
    descriptive statistics**

    - Two files must be **dynamically linked**

- **Another pair** makes a **pull request**. And this is discussed/merged.

## <i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i> Review (1)

- In R, what is the difference between a **matrix** and a **data frame**?

- What is the **assignment operator**?

- What is the **component selector**?

- What **two things** do you need to describe the distribution of a continuous
variable?

## <i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i> Review (2)

With a partner:

- What is the difference between **relative** and **absolute** file paths?

- What is a **commit**?

- What does it mean to **pull** and **push** a repo?

## What is Literate Programming?

[Donald Knuth (1992)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming):
explanation of a program using **natural language** interspersed
with **code snippets** that are compilable by a computer.

This produces **two representations** of the program:

- A formatted easily human readable document (e.g. a paper).

- Source code that can be compiled by a computer.

## Benefits

**Creates better programs**. Programmers have to explicitly state thoughts and in so
doing find flaws.

**Clear documentation** so that others can understand and build on the program
more easily.

## How literate programming relates to research?

<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i><i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i>
Quantitative social science **is computer programming**.

You are creating a program that gathers and analyses data.

You then **advertise** this work (a paper) in a way that is completely
understandable to others.

<br>

Added benefit: allows you to **automatically update** documents when there are changes.

## Implementing literate programming

In addition to the computer language, we need:

1. **Natural language part** formatted using a **markup language**.
Markup language: typesetting instructions. E.g. Markdown, $\LaTeX$, HTML.

2. A way to **tangle** or **weave** the **computer language** part into the natural
language part.

## Tangle/Weave for R

In R you can use Yihui Xie's [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package.

- Language dependent:

    + .Rmd <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> .html (using Markdown)

    + .Rnw <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> .pdf (using $\LaTeX$)

<br>

Note to use knitr in RStudio you need go to **Preferences > Sweave > Weave Rnw
files using: knitr**

## Knitr

Two parts:

- Natural language part written in intended markup language.

- R code (or almost any other language on your system) written in **code chunks**.

## Latex Example

![knitr example](img/simpleKnitrExampleOut.png)

## PDF Output

## The knitr process

![knit process](img/knitr_process.png)

## <i class="fa fa-language"></i> More recently

Most of the focus is on [RStudio's R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

- Directly builds on knitr (Yihui works at RStudio now).

    + Code chunk syntax is almost identical to Markdown in knitr.

- But uses [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to be more **output agnostic**.

    + You can write in (easy) R Markdown and output to **many different formats**.

## Markdown

Originally created by John Gruber to be an easy way to:

- write HTML files

- that are **human readable as text files**.

## Markdown: HTML less painful

**HTML**:

```
<h1>A header</h1>

<p>This is some text with a <a href="http://www.example.com">link</a></p>

<p>Here is some <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
```

**Markdown**:

```
# A header

This is some text with a [link](http://www.example.com).

Here is some **bold** text.
```

## Markdown syntax: Headers

```
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3
```

And so on.

## Markdown syntax

Horizontal lines:

```
---
```

Bold text:

```
**bold**
```

Italics:

```
*italics*
```

## Markdown syntax

Links:

```
[link](http://www.example.com)
```

Images:

```
![text description](FILE/PATH.png)
```

## Markdown syntax

Unordered Lists:

```
- An item

- An item

- An item
```

Ordered Lists:

```
1. Item one

2. Item two

3. Item three
```

## Tables

```
| Name   | Something |
| ------ | --------- |
| Stuff  | Things    |
| Things | Stuff     |
```

<br>

| Name   | Something |
| ------ | --------- |
| Stuff  | Things    |
| Things | Stuff     |

## Math

R Markdown from RStudio supports [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/). So, you can
write any [$\LaTeX$ math](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) with
R Markdown.

```
Inline equations have one dollar sign $s^2 =
\frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$.
```

**Inline equations** have one dollar sign $s^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$.

**Display equations** have two dollar signs:

```
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$
```

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$

## Expansion

You can include **any** HTML syntax in a Markdown document. You can also change the formatting by adding a **custom CSS** file (just like a website).

However, this will **only render in HTML output.**

If you are using $\LaTeX$ (other than math syntax), you can also include $\LaTeX$ syntax in your RMarkdown document for rendering as a PDF.

## Code chunks Inline

To use syntax highlighting on code chunks inline with the text, surround your text
with ``

Knitable inline chunks with a back-tick then `r`.

For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`.
```

Produces:

Two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`.

## Code chunks in Display

Use three ticks (```) to **start** and **end** a code chunk that is **not run**.

Create a **knit-able** code chunk begin the chunk with ````{r}`.

<img src="img/simpleRMarkdown.png" height=300, width=450/>

## Automatic table generation (basics)

You can turn any matrix or data frame into a well formatted table with the knitr
function `kable`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::kable(mtcars)
```

Make sure that the code chunk option `results='asis'`.

## Output Web

## Output PDF or Word

This R Markdown file can be compiled to PDF (via $\LaTeX$) or MS Word with RStudio.

![choose output](img/chooseOutput.png)

## Output PDF

<img src="img/simpleMarkdownPDF.png" height=500 width=425/>

## Output Word

<img src="img/simpleMarkdownWord.png" height=500 width=425/>

## Chunk options

Change how R Markdown chunks behave with **options**. Place
options in the chunk head: ````{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE}`

| Option          | What it Does                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `echo=FALSE`    | Does not print the code only the output                    |
| `error=FALSE`   | Does not print errors                                      |
| `include=FALSE` | Does not include the code or output, but does run the code |
| `fig.width`     | Sets figure width                                          |
| `cache=TRUE`    | Cache the chunk. It is only run when the contents change.  |

## RMarkdown Presentations

These lecture slides are created using R Markdown.

![presentation select](img/createPresentation.png)

## RMarkdown Presentations

All of the syntax is the same, **except**:

`##` Does not mean Header 2. It is creates a **new slide and title**.

You can create a slide with no title using `---`.

## R Markdown Header

The header lets you make changes to the whole document.

This presentation's head is:
